- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @InfoMedia5
A Web Developer/Jr. Software Engineer, I contributed significantly to development teams by designing, implementing, and maintaining software solutions. Working closely with senior engineers, I translated technical requirements into code and utilized various programming languages and frameworks to create user interfaces with responsive web design. Additionally, I gained proficiency in backend technologies, server-side logic, and database management. My responsibilities included debugging code, writing automated tests, and optimizing applications for performance and scalability. Actively participating in code reviews and pursuing continuous learning opportunities helped me enhance my skills and stay updated with industry best practices. With effective communication skills, I fostered productive teamwork across diverse teams, including designers, product managers, project owners and quality assurance testers.

I'm a proactive, 'go-getter' type personality. I excel in collaborative team environments but can seamlessly switch to an independent role when required. In the face of challenges, if I don't have an immediate answer, I am relentless in my pursuit until I find a solution within a reasonable timeframe. My experience includes contributing to exceptional team developments, and I consistently seek out like-minded individuals to foster a productive work environment.
